# Lua-MIPS
## About
This is a small personal project that I wrote in 2018. When I came back to look at it, I decided the code was presentable enough to put onto GitHub. "Presentable" does not mean "usable" here - this project was a stepping stone for me to learn more about processor architecture and emulation. The code is poorly documented and the emulator is hard to use if you... aren't me, which you probably aren't.

I don't recall exactly what MIPS spec I based this off of. I was eager enough to get started that I just found some PDF spec online and went straight to writing code. If I find the document I was reading, I'll push an update to this README.

## Possible Updates
I am not planning to update this anytime soon, but if I ever do, I would like to:
- [ ] Change the "compiled" format to something more practical
- [ ] Document the code better
- [ ] Write some more examples
